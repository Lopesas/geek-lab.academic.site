We are the **Genomic and Ecology of Eukaryotes** research team. We use high-thoughtput sequencing methods combine with wet lab strategies (e.g. microscopy, culture isolation) to study the ecology of natural occuring microbial eukaryotes populations.

While our laboratory just recently moved to Oslo (Norway) to join the Aquatic biology and toxicology section [AQUA](https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/research/sections/aqua/) at University of Oslo, some of the GEEK lab members continue working at our previous home in Singapore (Nanyang Technological University).
