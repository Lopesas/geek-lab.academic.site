abstract = "Did you know that there are many places on Earth that are frozen all year round? Can you imagine living your whole life in the bitter cold of snow and ice? Well, not only can some tiny microbes live comfortably in the cold, but many kinds of bacteria call such harsh places home! Just as a polar bear needs a thick coat to survive in the cold, these bacteria have their own ways of keeping themselves comfortable in the harsh environment. Scientists have found that these bacteria can teach us a lot about life in our solar system and that they are extremely useful in many industries."
