Chloropicophyceae are a group of pico (2 – 3 µm) planktonic green algae that were known previously as prasinophytes clade VII ([Lopes dos Santos et al., 2017](files/papers/ Lopes_2017b.pdf)). Since the isolation of the first strain in 1965, numerous rRNA sequences belonging to this group have been retrieved from the marine environment and many strains isolated. We gathered the sequence data available from strains and environmental samples to analyze the diversity of these tiny little green balls. First, by using different gene markers, we demonstrated that this group is composed of at least 10 different clades: A1 to A7 and B1 to B3 ([Lopes dos Santos et al., 2017](files/papers/Lopes_2017a.pdf)) which today is represented by at least one described species.  By using metabarcoding data from Tara Oceans and Ocean Sampling Day projects we were able to show that this group is one of the dominant Chlorophyta (green algae) group in oceanic waters, especially in areas where nutrients concentrations are moderately low.
