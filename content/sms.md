The Singapore Marine Strains (SMS) collection, an algae culture collection dedicated to strains from tropical equatorial regions, was stablished in 2019 with the support of MOE (Singapore Ministry of Education) Academic Research Funding (AcRF) Tier 1 (RG26/19). 

Currently the collection contains about a 100 strains of mostly photosynthetic eukaryotes (microalage) isolated from Singapore waters.
