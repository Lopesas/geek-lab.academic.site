The ES4002 provides valuable opportunity to get involve in a scientific research and experience the routine of a research group. Undergraduate research experiences such FYP are essential in providing the students the skills applicable to many jobs and prepare for graduate level programs. This opportunity might help students as well as to decide which career path at this point they would like to pursue. Over a period of 1 or 2 semesters, students will learn to assess possible environmental issues and develop potential research questions.

With the guidance of a research supervisor, each student will identify a research problem, formulate research questions, and conduct original research. The student must understand and be able to communicate both the research problem and its relevance. At the end of the Final Year Project, each student will present his or her work both orally and in writing as a senior thesis. A written senior thesis is required for first class honors as a product of a Final Year Project.
