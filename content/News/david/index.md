Big congratulations to ASE graduate David Mah and first student to join the lab! David joined the lab as URECA (Undergraduate Research Experience on CAmpus) in 2018/2019. In 2020 he returned to pursue his final year reserch project, a DYI automatic sampler device for the study of phytoplankton growth ([Fightoplankton: a low cost automatic sampler for the study of phytoplankton cell cycle](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/Fightoplankton_A_low-cost_automatic_sampler_for_the_study_of_phytoplankton_cell_cycle/14798013).

David received two awards,including the most prestigious medal a student at NTU can be awarded, the Lee Kuan Yew Gold Medal. So proud!

Davidâ€™s personal qualities are as impressive as his intellectual accomplishments.  He is a very kind,charismatic and respectful.  Along with his natural curiosity, confidence and strong values, I have no doubt David will becomea leader in his field in the future.  We will miss you!
