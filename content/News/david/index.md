Summer of 2023 holds one of the most special places in my heart. The three months in Roscoff gave me a huge boost in my academic and personal growth. As I reflect on my journey of discovery and friendship in Roscoff, I am filled with gratitude for the incredible experiences and people that have shaped me.

**The Science**: With coordination and strong support from my PhD supervisor, Adriana Lopes, I was given the opportunity to have a research attachment at the Station Biologique de Roscoff (SBR) in France. The main objective was to characterize a cell-to-cell interaction between the parasite Labyrinthula and its photosynthetic host, *Biddulphia. This work is an integral part of my PhD thesis that focuses on protist community structure and dynamics. It is important to investigate interactions between cells because they have significant implications for the dynamics and functioning of the marine ecosystem (e.g., nutrient cycling, population dynamics).

My research would not have been possible without the technical and logistical support from the Roscoff Culture Collection (RCC), which kindly hosted me for this attachment, especially Priscillia Gourvil, who also graciously introduced me to the entire plankton team (ECOMAP -Ecology of Marine Plankton) and gave me the most thorough lab induction. There, I also had the honor of working with and learning from confocal microscopist Marie Walde and electron microscopist Sophie Le Panse. The work we have done together was exciting as we produced never-seen-before confocal and transmission electron images that showcase this specific cell-to-cell interaction. I am so grateful to have worked with these incredible scientists as their guidance, support, and unwavering belief in my potential pushed me to excel in ways I never thought possible. Their encouragement toward me, alongside their wisdom and passion for science, were highly motivating.

Apart from my collaborators, I have also met several inspiring scientists in the station, all of whom I look up to. Being in a marine station has exposed me to a large variety of people working on different aspects of the marine ecosystem (people studying marine viruses, protists, macroalgae, invertebrates, etc.), which has broadened my knowledge in this field.

**The People and the Culture**: As this trip only lasted three months, I completely did not expect myself to have made so many sincere connections and fully immerse myself in the local culture. I thought I would just be laser-focused on the scientific work, but I was wrong! I am grateful that everyone from SBR welcomed me with such love and consistently cared for me â€“ ranging from the smallest things like taking me grocery shopping, to inviting me to countless parties and festivals. I participated in local festivals like the Artichoke Festival and Onion Festival, took part in traditional Brittany dances, and frequently played (competitively) Palet Breton, a traditional game unique to the region of Brittany. Doing these with my friends allowed me to appreciate the beautiful culture of Brittany.

It was the friends that I have made from SBR that made my experiences so memorable. They always made sure I was comfortable and were always looking out for me in every way possible. I am certain these friendships are going to be lifelong, and I will cherish all the memories we had. I will never forget the trips around Brittany, the meals we had together in homes and restaurants, the parties and drinks we had, and the conversations we had late into the night.

To all my peers in academia, I urge you to seize opportunities to explore the world of science beyond your comfort zone. You never know where your next adventure may take you or the incredible friends and mentors you may meet along the way. My experience in Roscoff will forever remind me that the pursuit of knowledge is a journey worth embarking on, and that international friendships are the treasures we discover along the way.
